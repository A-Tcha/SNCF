# SNCF - Objects lost in trains (France)

This a personal project using data from SNCF (French National railway company). The data set used is about objects which have been found in trains. The main goal of this project is to vizualize objects found on a map.

The data is available in Tableau on this link: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/adrien3276/viz/SNCF-LostFoundObject/Feuille2

More informartion about the data can be found here: https://ressources.data.sncf.com/explore/dataset/objets-trouves-restitution/api/?sort=date


The script sncf_get_data.py fetches the data for every days within the date range selected. Once the script is finished, the output is saved as an Excel file (.xlsx). The Excel file is then used for building the map in Tableau.


Notes:
The project is still ongoing
